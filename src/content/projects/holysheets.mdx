In a quest for an elegant solution to interact with the Google Sheets API, I encountered a challenge: the complexity of the API was like a dense forest, full of traps and winding paths.

    ```

### Basic Usage

With Holysheets! you can perform various operations easily, including reading, writing, updating, and deleting data in your Google Sheets.

#### Reading Data

```typescript
const userSheet = hollySheets.base<User>('Users');
const user = await userSheet.findFirst({
  where: {
    email: 'john.doe@example.com'
  }
});
```

#### Writing Data

```typescript
await userSheet.insert({
  data: {
    name: 'Jane Smith',
    email: 'jane.smith@example.com',
    age: 30
  }
});
```

#### Updating Data

```typescript
await userSheet.updateFirst(
  { where: { name: { contains: 'Jane' } } },
  { data: { age: 31 } }
);
```

#### Deleting Data

```typescript
await userSheet.deleteFirst({ where: { age: 31 } });
```

#### Clearing Data

Unlike deletion, clearing only removes the data from a row in the table, without removing the row itself.

```typescript
await userSheet.clearMany({ where: { age: 31 } });
```
